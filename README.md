# My-Library
A library where you can keep track of your reading books , and achieve the year goal at reading ;) <br>
-I have provided a form which lets the users to enter new books <br>
-The program has the localStorage propriety implemented, so that the books will not disappear when the page is closed or refreshed <br>
-The users cand also change the read status of the book, and doing so a message will be displayed, to inform them <br>
-The program also has a review system for each book, based on three emojis (loved,it was okay,or didn't like at all) <br>
-The user can remove any book they added, being deleted from the localStorage as well <br>
-And finally the library has a READING GOAL, where users cand enter their goal at reading, and if that goal is reached, a congratulations message will be displayed
